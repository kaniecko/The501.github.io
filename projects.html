                <p>My current project is with my job. I am maintaining and updating the Darpet Inc. website. My current project within the company is to create a reputable online store that sells products that are as pristine as the doors sold on site. I have been identifying and photographing new images of the hardware sold at Darpet. I will continue with creating a database for the sold items and customers which will benefit the company by being able to compare sales and many other data points.</p>
